## Machine Status Logic & Scenarios

### Statuses
- `free` â†’ `running` â†’ `finishedGrace` â†’ `free`

### How Transitions Happen
- **free â†’ running**: User starts a machine via check-in page. Status and timer are set in the database.
- **running â†’ finishedGrace**: Happens automatically. A server-side background process (MachineStatusManager) checks every 30 seconds. When the timer expires, status changes to `finishedGrace` and a 5-minute grace period starts.
- **finishedGrace â†’ free**: Also automatic. After the grace period, the server process sets the machine to `free` and clears user info. The original user can also manually mark as collected, which frees the machine immediately.

### Timing
- Automatic transitions are checked every 30 seconds. Status changes are visible to all users in real time (usually within 0â€“30 seconds, average 15s).
- No one needs to refresh the page; updates are pushed via Supabase real-time subscriptions.

### User Scenarios
| Status           | Who Can Act?         | What Happens Next?                |
|------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| free             | Anyone               | Can start a new session           |
| running          | Owner                | Can stop early or wait            |
| running          | Others               | See warning, cannot act           |
| finishedGrace    | Owner                | Can mark as collected             |
| finishedGrace    | Others               | See warning, cannot act           |
| free (after grace)| Anyone              | Can start a new session           |

### Technical Details
- The MachineStatusManager (see `src/lib/machineStatusManager.ts`) runs on the server and checks machine timers every 30 seconds.
- All status transitions after a user starts a machine are handled automatically by this process.
- No user action is required for machines to become available after timer/grace period expiry.
- All clients receive updates in real time via Supabase subscriptions.
